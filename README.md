# Emanuel Blaga Portofolio website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute.

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio highlights two projects that covers a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form. 
I wanted to comunicate technology via a modern design prefering ilustrations and light spectrum colors ( Anything than comes from the variation of natural lights such as white, yellow , red, blue  to bridge  with my lighting engineer experience 

## Wireframe

Adobe XD was used to create the wireframe and style of this website.

# Testing

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be no error noting the invalid email address as this is a reset button for now to be developped in the future . Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, but for now even if those fields are not filled in, the form will reset.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and the CV will download to your default folder for downloads on click using the 'download' attribute. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.


This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) and on  mobile devices (iPhone 11Max) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. The about me background images poses some chalanges particularly on samller screens wher it tends to move up in Z
